Publisher/Subscriber
====================
Known as *Observer* in the GoF's book, this pattern allows an object, called *publisher*, to notify other objects, the *subscribers*, when its state changes.

From *Design Patterns*, the intent of this pattern is the following:

>[To] define a one-to-may dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependent are notified and updated automatically.
